  * We found a bug! Be careful with all neat_grids until you update passivbot and use the new configurations that will be posted here in batches. I will replicate what I have pushed here so far, using the new bug fix. Patience! :) <3 

  * Side note, it does appear that feedback has been great from current batches even with this bug that has been found. I have been quite profitable as well, but will re optimize with the bug fix as it's proper measure. 

Partials of batches are being pushed multiple times per day, please be careful and run your own backtests and use safe wallet exposures. Batch 1.4 is very interesting to me.

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.

Also if you are using my configurations, please give feedback on discord in Passivbot server or my Discord flyingtoaster#3285
