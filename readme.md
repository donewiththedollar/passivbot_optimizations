Partials of batches are being pushed multiple times per day, please be careful and run your own backtests and use safe wallet exposures. Batch 1.4 is very interesting to me.

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.

Also if you are using my configurations, please give feedback on discord in Passivbot server or my Discord flyingtoaster#3285
