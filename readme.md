* Updates
  * Reorganized, did not delete any configs. Please do not use v5.7.0 configs with v5.7.1, they are not backwards compatable
  * Reoganized again :)

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.

Also if you are using my configurations, please give feedback on discord in Passivbot server or my Discord flyingtoaster#3285
