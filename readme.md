I like the idea of autounstucking, however I enjoy being able to change my wallet exposures without having the autounstucking kick in. Ie. Market structure changes, you lower wallet exposures on one side to change your L/S ratio. 

Upon doing so, you end up with positions going into loss harvesting to catch better entries to utilize margin better. Auto unstucking works! However, I would like to take no losses and be able to modify wallet_exposure on the fly. 

Also, more importantly you should never really have to change your wallet exposures on the fly per say if you are using proper risk management to begin with- ie. Proper configurations that are not too aggressive, and low WE to begin with. 

So while I strongly believe my theory makes sense to not use auto unstucking, I would caution against treating wallet exposure as some number you can change every day. There is very little probability that can be safe.

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone â€”branch v5.7.0_neat_grid https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.
