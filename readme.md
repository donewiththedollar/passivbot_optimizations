# Passivbot Configurations
## Updates
  * Currently optimizing with 1s tick on single asset in bulk batches. Backtest is in 1s tick as well.
  * Live configs that have proven to work well so far with latest PB version, but are not 1s tick https://github.com/donewiththedollar/passivbot_v5.7.1/tree/main/configs/live/PBSO/1m/0.1.2_auenabled_longshort

Proper risk management is key. Keep your wallet exposures low!
