# Passivbot Configurations
## Updates
  * **8/4/2023** I quit my job 10 days short of a year ago to persue optimizing for this project and found myself heavily into algorithmic trading and quantitative analytics. I never stopped, and refuse to. Enjoy and assess risk accordingly. I am not leaving.
  * Currently optimizing with OHLCV
