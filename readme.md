* Updates
  * 1.4 is long scalp, safe short
  * 1.5 is safer long scalp, safer short
  * Please check parameters and do your own backtests, also use proper risk management by keeping total wallet exposures per account below 3.0 on long side, and about 1.5 on short side.
  * Reorganized, did not delete any configs. Please do not use v5.7.0 configs with v5.7.1, they are not backwards compatable

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.

Also if you are using my configurations, please give feedback on discord in Passivbot server or my Discord flyingtoaster#3285
