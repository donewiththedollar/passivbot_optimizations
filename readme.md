  * DO NOT USE ANY CONFIGURATION BELOW "1.4 BUG FIX" commits if you have upgraded your passivbot to the lastest main branch. 
  
  * If you have not updated, you should not if you do not have optimized configurations ready to use after the upgrade. The configurations in this repository below "1.4 BUG FIX" on the commit comments are not backwards compatable with the latest passivbot update. The new optimizations are being pushed here as fast as possible, and will include bug fix in the commit comments. I will not remove the old configs but will reorganize later, as they do work just fine on your current build as long as you have not updated passivbot to the latest from yesterdays bug fix. (July 20th bug fix).
  
  * To clarify, as long as you have not updated your passivbot on July 20th, you can continue to use the configurations here below 1.4 BUG FIX. But anything 1.4 BUG FIX and above, you must have your passivbot updated to the latest version. You will be seeing those configs pushed ASAP.

  * We found a bug! Be careful with all neat_grids until you update passivbot and use the new configurations that will be posted here in batches. I will replicate what I have pushed here so far, using the new bug fix. Patience! :) <3 

  * Side note, it does appear that feedback has been great from current batches even with this bug that has been found. I have been quite profitable as well, but will re optimize with the bug fix as it's proper measure. 

Partials of batches are being pushed multiple times per day, please be careful and run your own backtests and use safe wallet exposures. Batch 1.4 is very interesting to me.

Risk management is key. STAY SAFE EVERYONE! 

Also thanks to enarjord for this amazing project! 

To install, ``git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git``

You must be using neat_grid branch to use most configurations posted here, but I will be optimizing for recursive and static for comparison.

Also if you are using my configurations, please give feedback on discord in Passivbot server or my Discord flyingtoaster#3285
